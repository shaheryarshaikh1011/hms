# Project Title
* This is a Hospital Management System WebApp made by Nodejs with a separate Panel for Admin and Separate Panel for the receptionist(user).

  *	 Hospital management system web app is developed for keeping records of hospital data and managing it regarding patients, doctors, and appointments.
  *	 This web app will provide the facility to admin and user to login using his credentials and view, add, modify the hospital records.
  *	 The main motive of this system is to computerize all the records regarding doctors, patients and be able to access them anywhere in the world



# Motivation

## Disadvantages of traditional record-keeping

* 	Book-based records have no security they can be easily modified.
* 	Records can be lost due to calamities like floods , fire ,earthquakes.
* 	Suppose the hospital has two branches and a patient visits branch A for his first appointment and then branch B for his second appointment, then his data will only be at branch one which would have to be copied entirely at branch B  hence recursion issue happens.
*   Data at either branch may be different because data will get updated at different times, hence this is also a disadvantage as data will not be consistent.

## Advantages of hms web-app

* No need for different people at different branches to manage the data, a single person i.e. the Admin will be able to manage data of all the branches.
* It helps to reduce cost as data is computerized instead of a paper-book based system
* Increases data security as only people having credentials i.e. login id and password can access the data.
* It reduces human errors such as wrong appointment time, date, or wrong doctor and patient details.
* Accessing data is very easy, using the software data can be accessed anywhere in the world using the internet
